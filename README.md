opam-dockerfiles
=================

This repository contains a set of branches that each contain a different
combination of Dockerfiles on different distributions.  The intention is to
make the [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org) source code package manager easily
available via the Docker Hub, so that it can be used in automated testing of
OPAM and OCaml packages using services such as Travis CI.

This service is still experimental.
Please contact Anil Madhavapeddy <anil@recoil.org> if you have any queries
about it.
